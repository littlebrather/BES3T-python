Reads Bruker EPR spectrometer .DSC+.DTA files

Bruker EPR spectrometers of certain generation tend to store spectra in a specific way in two or more separate files, containing experiment parameters, data and abscissa axis, depending from the setup.
@stestoll made an impressive tool once for Matlab, making it possible to load almost any type of these EPR spectra in his outstanding Easyspin project. However the Python implementation of Easyspin is still to go.
@KonstantinKonov realized his implementation of BES3T import tool for JPNB
Here is another variant of BES3T Python Import which may be useful for you.
